# EV_Virtual_City-1.0

Introduction:

EV Virtual City 1.0 is an agent-based simulator built on Repast Simphony (http://repast.sourceforge.net/). Based on the RepastCity project (http://nickmalleson.co.uk/software/repastcity/) developed by Dr. Nick Malleson, I rewrote some of the classes and added more features to original project. EV Virtual City 1.0 amis to simulate the interplays between the electric vehicles (EVs), the transportation network, the electric power network, the urban infrastructure, the EV charging stations, etc.

This project contains many traffic and city infrastructure objects, such as road, route, residence, workplace, restaurant, shopping mall, supermarket, electric vehicle, EV charging station, etc.

How to use:

(1) First, you need to install the Repast Suite which can be downloaded from http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.php

(2) Download the EV_Virtual_City 1.0 project

(3) Usually, the Eclipse is bundled with the Repost Suite. So after you install the Repast Simphony, you can open the Eclipse and import EV_Virtual_City 1.0 as an existing project and just run it. You can modify, rewrite or add some classes in this project to satisfy your simulation needs
